# Security Policy
This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for maintaining and 
safeguarding the security of the REST API. 
It provides information on how security vulnerabilities are addressed, 
reporting procedures, and the overall approach to securing our API.

## Scope
This security policy applies to all aspects of our Flask/Python-based REST API, 
encompassing the codebase, server infrastructure, data handling, and associated services.
Third-party services or products used by the API are not covered by this policy.

### Supported Versions
All versions of the API are eligible for hotfixes or patches. 
We prioritize security support irrespective of the environment the API is running on. 
However, outdated or unreasonable environments may not be supported.

## Reporting Security Issues
To report a security vulnerability, create an issue in the relevant repository. 
Please follow these steps:

- Assign the issue to @DeadlyFirex.
- Apply appropriate labels, especially the "vulnerability" label to the issue.
- Mention @DeadlyFirex within the issue description or comments.

## Handling of Reported Issues
Upon reporting a vulnerability:

- The issue will be addressed and fixed within 48 hours, and you'll be notified of its status.
- We kindly request that no information about the vulnerability is publicly disclosed before it's resolved.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and cooperation in maintaining the security of our API.
For any urgent security concerns, reach out directly.
